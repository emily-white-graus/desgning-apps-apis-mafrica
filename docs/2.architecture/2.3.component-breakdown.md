# 2. Architecture

## 2.3 Component breakdown

---

## What are the elements of my project?

They are

**Users**

* **employees** – create maintenance or service requests and track progress
* **technicians** – view assigned work, update status, and resolve tasks
* **supervisors** – oversee the full workflow, assign technicians, and monitor performance

**Frontends**

* **employee webapp** (simple UI for submitting and tracking requests)
* **technician dashboard** (list of jobs, filters, status updates)
* **supervisor dashboard** (overview, assignments, light reporting)

**and Backends**

* **main API**

  * handles all requests from all frontends
  * manages core logic: creating requests, updating status, adding comments, assigning technicians
  * exposes a simple, rest-style HTTP API

* **notification worker**

  * runs in the background to send emails/alerts when something changes
  * helps keep the main API responsive (so things feel fast)

**Data store**

* **relational database** with a few main entities:

  * users
  * service_requests
  * assignments
  * comments / activity_log
  * assets or locations (maybe optional)

**External integrations**

* **email/notification provider** (simple API for sending updates)
* (optional) **SSO or identity provider** for login if needed later
