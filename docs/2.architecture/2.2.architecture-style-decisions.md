# 2. Architecture

## 2.2 Architecture style decision

---

## Which architectural patterns will apply?

* **layered monolith for the backend**

  * controllers (HTTP layer)
  * service layer (business logic)
  * data layer (DB access)
  * *(keeps things organized but still simple and deployable as one app)*

* **modular frontends**

  * separate views for each user type
  * all talk to the same backend API

* **async worker pattern**

  * notification worker sends emails without blocking user requests
  * *(basically: slow stuff happens in the background)*

* **why this makes sense**
    * MafricaFix is an internal tool, not public internet scale → monolith is simpler and faster to build
    * async worker lets me keep request/response quick even if email provider is slow
    * easier to evolve into something more complex later (e.g., split worker or APIs) if needed
