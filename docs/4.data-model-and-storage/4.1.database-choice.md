# 4. Data model & storage

## 4.1 Database choice & justification

---

for mvp, i’m choosing **PostgreSQL** (managed, if possible).

**why postgres**

* strong relational model fits the data well: users, requests, comments, assignments
* good support for transactions and constraints
* widely supported, easy to run locally and in the cloud
* simple to evolve schema over time (migrations)

**why not the others (for now)**

* **MySQL** also fine, but postgres has slightly nicer json + indexing features and i’m more likely to find examples/tools for it.
* **MongoDB / document dbs** – requests have pretty stable structure, and relationships matter (joins), so relational is simpler.
* **DynamoDB / key-value** – overkill/complex for a single-company internal app, haven't used it before.
