# 4. Data model & storage

## 4.3 Data access & patterns

---

**reads**

* employees:

  * mostly read “my requests” and individual request details
* technicians:

  * read “my assigned requests”
* supervisors:

  * read “all open requests”, filters, and simple reports

**writes**

* creating requests (employees)
* status updates and notes (technicians + supervisors)
* assignments (supervisors)

**caching**

* for mvp, i’m **not adding a cache layer** (no Redis yet):

  * traffic is limited (internal app)
  * simpler to keep data consistent
* if needed later:

  * we could cache “lists of open requests” or “my assigned jobs” per technician
  * or add a small in-memory cache in the api for read-heavy endpoints

**syncing**

* no cross-database sync in mvp (single db)
* main “sync-like” concern is making sure async emails match the current state:

  * worker always fetches the latest request state from the db before sending an email
