## 1.3 Requirements

---

## Functional requirements

* employees can:

  * create new maintenance/service requests
  * see the status of their own requests (open, in progress, resolved, etc.)
  * add comments or extra info to their requests

* technicians can:

  * see requests assigned to them
  * update status (e.g. “in progress”, “on hold”, “resolved”)
  * add work notes

* supervisors can:

  * see all requests across locations
  * filter by status, priority, location, assignee
  * assign or reassign technicians
  * close or reopen requests
  * view simple reports (e.g. open vs resolved)

* system can:

  * send email notifications when a request is created, assigned, or resolved
  * keep a basic activity log for each request

## Non-functional requirements

* **availability:** internal tool, but should be up during working hours (aim for “9–5 with minimal downtime”)
* **performance:** normal operations should respond in under ~500ms for typical pages; background email sending can be a bit slower
* **security:**

  * authenticated access only (no anonymous access)
  * role-based authorization for sensitive actions
  * transport encryption with HTTPS
* **scalability:**

  * must handle several Mafrica offices and a few hundred active users, not internet scale
  * design should still allow horizontal scaling of the API later if needed
* **observability (lightweight for mvp):**

  * basic logging of errors and important events
  * simple metrics like number of requests created, failed emails (even if just logs at first)
* **maintainability:**

  * clear separation between layers (controllers, services, data)
  * straightforward local dev environment
