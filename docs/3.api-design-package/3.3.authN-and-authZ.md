# 3. API design

## 3.3 AuthN and AuthZ

---

## What kind of authN and authZ will be needed where?

**authN (who you are)**

* simple login (email + password or optional SSO)
* users receive a session or token after signing in

**authZ (what you can do)**
role-based permissions:

* **employee**

  * create requests
  * view and comment on their own requsts

* **technician**

  * view assigned work
  * update status and add notes

* **supervisor**

  * view all requests
  * assign work
  * close or reopen requests
  * acces light reporting

**here auth is enforced**

* checked on every request at the **main API**
* API verifies role + resource ownership (ex: employees can’t access other employees’ requests)
